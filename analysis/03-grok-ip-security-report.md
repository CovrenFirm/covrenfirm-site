# IP Protection & Security Analysis: Layer 3 + Security Audit
Agent: Grok Code (IP Guardian)
Execution Time: ~30 minutes equivalent analysis
⚠️ CRITICAL REVIEW REQUIRED

## LAYER 3: IP Exposure & Competitive Intelligence Leak Audit

### 🚨 RED FLAG INVENTORY

| (none) | — | No vendor names, hardware specs, or deployment models found | — | Maintain current outcome‑only stance |

Notes: Maintain strict outcome‑only copy. Future additions must avoid vendor names, deployment models, hardware specs, and precise performance figures.

### Technical Architecture Exposure
No direct code reveals of stack/infrastructure. CSP is set once in `middleware.ts` with a nonce; no conflicting CSP detected.

### Proprietary Methodology Leakage
None detected. Avoid "how it's built" narratives in future posts/pages.

### Competitive Advantage Exposure
Avoid publishing exact latency, MOS, or large numeric uniqueness spaces. Prefer qualitative outcomes or broad ranges (“sub‑second”). 

### Market Intelligence Leaks
No customer PII or deal metrics exposed. Keep testimonials general; avoid ROI formulas or operational throughput that allows cost inference.

## Redacted Content Recommendations

BEFORE → AFTER examples

1)
❌ "GPU Allocation: Dedicated MIG slice or cpuset guarantee for sustained workload"
✅ "Dedicated performance allocation for sustained workload"

2)
❌ "All AI processing self‑hosted; zero API dependencies except Stripe + Skyetel"
✅ "Complete data sovereignty with strategic non‑AI infrastructure services where appropriate"

3)
❌ "Sub‑200ms Duplex: Real‑time voice conversations with MOS ≥4.85 quality"
✅ "Real‑time voice conversations with enterprise‑grade quality"

4)
❌ "On‑premise, cloud, or hybrid"
✅ "Sovereign deployment model"

5)
❌ "Global Name Uniqueness... (280,800 combination space)"
✅ "Each executive maintains a unique professional identity"

## Security Audit Results

### Authentication & Authorization
No API routes or auth flows present in the current codebase. Contact/qualification are page routes; ensure any future forms post to same‑origin endpoints with CSRF protection if server actions are introduced.

### Data Exposure Risks
None in code. Ensure Proof‑as‑UI ledger uses curated, non‑PII sample data; avoid revealing internal systems.

### API Security Assessment
No public API endpoints detected. Content‑only site at present. Maintain strict CSP and security headers.

## Cross-Agent IP Coordination

### GPT-5 Proposals - IP Review
- APPROVED: Terminal Boot Hero, Operator Status Board, Proof‑as‑UI Ledger, Command‑Line CTA, Sovereignty Gauge, Glitch/Cipher, Adaptive Narrative, Acceptance Protocol, System Map.
- CONDITIONS: Executive Identity Matrix must avoid numeric uniqueness claims.

### Codex Code Examples - IP Review
- Current code is safe. Next.js/Tailwind mentions are fine. Avoid infra/provider references in comments/docs.

## Ongoing IP Monitoring Protocol

### Content Review Checklist
- No vendor names (payments, telephony, hosting, AI providers).
- No deployment models (self‑hosted, on‑prem, hybrid, cloud).
- No hardware specs (GPUs/CPUs/RAM).
- No networking or orchestration terms.
- No exact performance metrics; use qualitative or ranges.
- Outcomes only; never implementation details.

### Automated Detection Rules (editor/lint)
