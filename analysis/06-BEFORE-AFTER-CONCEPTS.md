# Before/After Visual Concepts
Lead: GPT-5 | Tech Validation: Codex | IP Clearance: Grok Code

## Hero Section
### Current State
- Strong headline; static proof. Emotional impact fades after initial read.

### Proposed Redesign
- Terminal Boot Hero: abstract boot sequence revealing core value lines (no infra terms), ending with a minimal prompt (“> brief me”).
- Reduced-motion fallback: instant reveal of key lines without animation.
- CTA group: “Qualify Now” + “Book Briefing” inline under prompt.
- ✅ Codex: Feasible with CSS transforms; low JS. Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- ✅ Grok: Approved with outcomes-only copy.

## Product Showcase (Sovren AI)
### Current State
- Clear copy; includes risky specifics (now redacted).

### Proposed Redesign
- Operator Status Board: cards showing sealed, recent actions (pre-rendered, curated).
- Proof-as-UI Ledger component reusable across pages.
- ✅ Codex: Feasible; static-first, enhance on client.
- ✅ Grok: Approved (no vendors/metrics/infra).

## Pricing Page
### Current State
- Static plan cards with bullets.

### Proposed Redesign
- Interactive deltas: “What changes on day 1 / week 1 / month 1” (copy-only outcomes).
- Toggle: “Show me throughput deltas” (no internal metrics).
- ✅ Codex: Feasible.
- ✅ Grok: Approved (no numbers tied to infra).

## Application Flow
### Current State
- Standard contact/qualification.

### Proposed Redesign
- Progressive disclosure: intent → context → acceptance protocol (ritualized “approved”).
- Sticky dual-CTA present across steps.
- ✅ Codex: Feasible with server actions or forms later.
- ✅ Grok: Approved (no PII exposed publicly; outcomes language).

## 3 “Holy Fuck” Concepts (Visual Notes)
1) Terminal Boot Hero
- Black canvas → subtle scanlines → lines of approved copy “decrypt” in.
- Final state reveals prompt + CTAs. No infra references.

2) Operator Status Board
- Masonry cards with time + executive + action + outcome tag.
- Animates in on scroll; respects reduced motion.

3) Proof-as-UI Ledger
- Narrow list with timestamped entries and sealed badge.
- Lives on homepage and Sovren AI; curated entries only.
